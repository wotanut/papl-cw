class Flight(SQLModel, table=True):
    """
    The Flight model. Some important information

    Parameters
    ----------
    ID: Must be exactly 7 characters with at least the first 3 being an ICAO code
    stage: A value from FlightStage, default's to PreDep
    dep, dest, altn: A 4 digit ICAO code that is regex enforced. Ideally should be in uppercase anyway, but will return uppercase regardless of what you put in.
    ete: Enroute Time Expected, a 4 digit string that is formatted such as 0019 for each minute you are expected to fly.
    ADCReq: Used to specify if the user should be asked for an ADC, defualt is calculated on the change to cruise and has a 50/50 chance of occuring. Specifying a value will override this.

    Examples
    --------
    > Flight(id="AAL1254", stage="Departing",dep="EGLL", dest="KJFK",altn="CYYZ",ete="0015")

    > Flight(id="BAW15K", stage="Departing",dep="EGLL", dest="KJFK",altn="CYYZ",ete="0015",ADCReq=True)

    > Flight(id="VIR27L", stage="Departing",dep="EGLL", dest="KJFK",altn="CYYZ",ete="0015",ADCReq=False)
